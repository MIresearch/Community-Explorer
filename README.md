<H2><b> The Community Explorer</b> </H2> <Hr>

The <b>Community Explorer</b> groups a wide variety of data—from economic and demographic numbers to education, housing, and health features— at the county level to tell a deeper story than what can be told when looking at few indicators at a time. Using machine learning techniques to cluster 751 county-level variables from the American Community Survey
  
The 17 community profiles mapped below were identified using machine learning techniques to cluster 751 county-level variables (behavioral, demographic, economic, and social factors) from the American Community Survey.
