<H2><b> The Community Explorer (17 profiles based on 751 factors) **beta version**</b> </H2> <Hr>

The <b>Community Explorer</b> groups a wide variety of data—from economic and demographic numbers to education, housing, and health features— at the county level to tell a deeper story than when using few indicators at one time. 
  
More specifically, we cluster the 751 variables (behavioral, demographic, economic, and social factors) for 3142 counties into 17 population profiles using machine learning techniques.
