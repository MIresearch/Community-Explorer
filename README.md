The <b>Community Explorer</b> groups a wide variety of data—from economic and demographic numbers to education, housing, and health features— at the county level to tell a deeper story than what can be told when looking at few indicators at a time. Using machine learning techniques to cluster 751 county-level variables from the American Community Survey
  
The 17 community profiles mapped below were identified using machine learning techniques to cluster 751 county-level variables (behavioral, demographic, economic, and social factors) from the American Community Survey. These profiles are:
  <b>Mainstream America</B> captures 74% of the US population and encompasses Urban Core counties and Suburban and Small Metro counties (819 counties).
<br><b>1</b> the most ethnically diverse community with the highest income level. It is a highly educated cohort that resides in large metro areas. (26% US population)
<br><b>2</b> mainly includes less populous Suburban and Small Metro counties which are not as economically prosperous as other American mainstream counties. (18% US population)
<br><b>3</b> includes affluent and more populous Suburban and Small Metro counties with at least 1 million residents (16% US population)
<br><b>4</b> capture the middle-class populations that reside in large- to medium-sized Suburban and Small Metro counties (14% US population)

 <b>Industry-driven America</B> captures 18% of the US population and encompasses counties concentrated in one inductry which shapes all aspects of their population’s profile (1507 counties).
  <br><b>5</b> predominantly White counties whose economy depends mostly on manufacturing and are located around the Midwest region. (6% US population) 
<br><b>6</b> the youngest cohort of the profiles, with the largest Hispanic population, the least education level, access to healthy food, and health insurance. The counties are concentrated in the West and West South-Central regions.  (5% US population)
<br><b>7</b> the oldest cohort of the profiles and consists of mostly White, elderly retirement communities. (4% US population)
<br><b>8</b> the most rural cohort made of an older White population with the most limited access to healthy food of all the profiles. The counties are mostly in the north part of the West, Midwest, and Northeast regions. (3% US population)<br>
